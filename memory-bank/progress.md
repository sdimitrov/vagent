# Progress: SociAI Reels (Refined by TASK_LIST.md)

## Current Project Status (as of Q2 2025)

Based on `TASK_LIST.md` and `PROJECT_PLAN.md`:
*   **Phase 1: Foundation & Core Setup** is marked as **Largely Complete**.
*   **Phase 2: Social Media Integration (YouTube Focus)** is **In Progress**.
    *   General OAuth setup for YouTube (authorize, callback, DB schema, UI components) is marked as **Complete**.
    *   Specific YouTube integration tasks like secure token encryption (logic TBD) and actual video upload testing (simulated) are **Partially Complete/Pending**.
*   **Phase 3: AI Video Generation - Core Engine** has some UI elements for input **Complete**, but core AI service integrations and full Remotion video assembly are mostly **Pending**.
*   **Phases 4, 5, 6** are largely **Pending**.
*   The project timeline from `PROJECT_PLAN.md` (Q3-Q4 2024 for Phase 2 completion) suggests the project may be behind schedule if the current date is Q2 2025 and Phase 2 is not fully complete.

## Detailed Feature/Task Status (from TASK_LIST.md)

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Setup (Largely Complete)
*   **Completed:** Next.js init, Tailwind, Clerk auth, basic project structure, ClerkProvider, Header with auth buttons, `middleware.ts` for route protection, basic Dashboard & Landing Page, `GetStartedButton` bugfix, initial docs (`PROJECT_PLAN.md`, `TASK_LIST.md`), PostgreSQL & Drizzle setup, API for deleting social connections, frontend for delete connection.

### Phase 2: Social Media Integration (YouTube Focus) (In Progress)
*   **2.1 General OAuth Setup (Completed for YouTube):**
    *   DB schema for `socialConnections` (`src/db/schema.ts`).
    *   Backend OAuth callback logic (`src/app/api/oauth/[platform]/callback/route.ts` for YouTube).
    *   UI for managing connected accounts (`src/app/dashboard/connections/`).
    *   OAuth initiation route (`src/app/api/oauth/[platform]/authorize/route.ts` for YouTube).
*   **2.2 YouTube (Shorts) Integration:**
    *   Google Cloud Platform app registration: Assumed complete (user task).
    *   YouTube Data API OAuth flow (token exchange & storage): Implemented.
    *   **[x] Secure token storage:** Real encryption logic implemented using AES-256-GCM (`src/lib/encryption.ts`). Tokens are now encrypted before DB storage and decrypted when retrieved. **(Pending Testing)**
    *   **[x] Implement YouTube video upload:** Actual upload call using `googleapis` is now implemented in `src/app/api/youtube/upload/route.ts`. **(Pending Testing)**
    *   **[ ] Optional: Token validation/refresh check for YouTube.**

### Phase 3: AI Video Generation - Core Engine (Mostly Pending)
*   **3.1 Input & Scripting:**
    *   **[x]** UI for text prompt, URL input, direct script input.
    *   OpenAI API Integration:
        *   **[x]** Text summarization (from URL).
        *   **[x]** Script generation assistance (from text prompt).
        *   **[ ]** Formatting user-provided script.
*   **3.2 Media Acquisition (e.g., Pexels/Pixabay):**
    *   **[ ]** Integrate stock media API.
    *   **[ ]** Backend logic to fetch/suggest media.
    *   **[~]** UI for AI-generated image review exists; stock media selection/upload for segments: **Not Implemented.**
*   **3.3 Voiceover & Captions:**
    *   **[ ]** Integrate TTS API.
    *   **[ ]** UI for TTS options.
    *   **[ ]** Backend logic for voiceover generation.
    *   **[ ]** Integrate caption generation.
    *   **[ ]** UI for reviewing/editing captions.
*   **3.4 Video Assembly (Remotion):**
    *   **[x]** Chosen Remotion as primary.
    *   **[ ]** Set up Remotion (install, scaffold) - *Note: `package.json` shows Remotion installed, `remotion/` dir exists, so this might be partially done.*
    *   **[ ]** Create Remotion composition for video assembly.
    *   **[ ]** Implement logic for sequencing, audio, captions, transitions.
    *   **[ ]** Render video to MP4.
    *   **[ ]** Integrate Remotion rendering into backend.
    *   **[ ]** Ensure output format/optimization for YouTube Shorts.
    *   **[ ]** (Optional) UI to preview Remotion video.

### Phase 4: Video Management & Basic YouTube Posting (Pending)
*   **[ ]** DB schema updates for video metadata.
*   **[ ]** UI for video list, preview, metadata editing, deletion.
*   **[ ]** Implement YouTube Upload Functionality (backend API, use tokens, handle responses).
*   **[ ]** Update UI to initiate upload.
*   **[ ]** Refine AI video generation quality.
*   **[ ]** Iterate on UI/UX.

### Phase 5 & 6 (Pending)
*   Beta Testing, Public Launch, Future Platform Planning.

## What's Actively Being Worked On (Inferred from Task List & Current Phase)
*   **Testing & Verification:** The implemented token encryption and YouTube video upload functionality require thorough testing.
*   Consideration of optional token validation/refresh logic for YouTube.

## Known Issues / Blockers (from TASK_LIST.md & Recent Changes)
*   **[RESOLVED] Landing Page 404/500 Error:** An issue causing errors when loading the landing page was due to a conflicting empty `app/layout.tsx` at the project root. This was resolved by removing the file.
*   **Testing Required:** The newly implemented encryption and upload features are untested.
*   Many core AI and video assembly features in Phase 3 are pending.

## Documentation Review
*   `docs/SCHEMA_SOCIAL_CONNECTIONS.md` reviewed and aligns with `src/db/schema.ts`.
*   This `progress.md` is now updated based on `docs/TASK_LIST.md`.
