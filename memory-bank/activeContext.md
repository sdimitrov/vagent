# Active Context: SociAI Reels

## Current Work Focus

*   **Phase 2 Completion (YouTube Integration):** Focusing on testing the implemented token encryption and YouTube video upload functionality.
*   Considering the optional task of token validation/refresh for YouTube.

## Recent Changes

*   **Token Encryption Implemented:**
    *   Created `src/lib/encryption.ts` with AES-256-GCM encryption/decryption utilities.
    *   Updated `src/app/api/oauth/[platform]/callback/route.ts` to use `encrypt()` for storing tokens.
    *   Updated `src/app/api/youtube/upload/route.ts` to use `decrypt()` for retrieving tokens.
*   **YouTube Video Upload Implemented:**
    *   Uncommented and integrated the actual YouTube video upload logic in `src/app/api/youtube/upload/route.ts` using `googleapis`.
*   Memory Bank files were previously created and aligned with project documentation.
*   **Landing Page 404/500 Error Resolved:** Diagnosed and fixed an issue causing errors when loading the landing page. The problem was an empty, conflicting `app/layout.tsx` file at the project root. Removing this file resolved the error, allowing Next.js to correctly use `src/app/layout.tsx`.

## Next Steps (Prioritized based on TASK_LIST.md & Current State)

1.  **Testing & Verification (Crucial):**
    *   Manually test the end-to-end YouTube OAuth flow: connecting an account, ensuring tokens are stored (and are indeed encrypted in the DB if checked manually), and then successfully uploading a video.
    *   This requires setting the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable and valid Google Cloud OAuth credentials.
2.  **(Optional but Recommended) Implement Token Validation/Refresh for YouTube:**
    *   **Task:** "Optional: Implement token validation/refresh check for YouTube."
    *   **Action:** If deemed necessary, plan and implement logic to:
        *   Check if the access token is expired or close to expiring before attempting an API call.
        *   Use the stored refresh token to obtain a new access token via Google's OAuth API.
        *   Update the stored (encrypted) tokens in the database.
3.  **Review and Refine Error Handling:** Ensure robust error handling in the OAuth and upload routes, providing clear feedback to the user or logging appropriately.
4.  **Update `.clinerules`:** Document the encryption strategy (AES-256-GCM, key from `ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var) and any patterns observed during this implementation.
5.  **Address any bugs or issues found during testing.**

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   **Security:** The implemented encryption relies on the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable being set and kept secure. This is a critical operational detail.
*   **Testing Environment:** A proper testing setup with valid credentials and a test YouTube account is essential to verify these changes.
*   **Next Major Features (Phase 3):** Once Phase 2 is confirmed stable, the focus will shift to AI Video Generation Core Engine (integrating stock media, TTS, and full Remotion video assembly).
