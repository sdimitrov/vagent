# Cline's Project Intelligence (.clinerules)

This file captures important patterns, preferences, and project-specific intelligence to help Cline work more effectively on the "vagent" project. It will be updated as new insights are discovered.

## General Principles & Preferences

## Code Patterns & Conventions
*   **App Router Directory Structure:** The project uses `src/app/` for its Next.js App Router files (e.g., `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/app/page.tsx`). Be cautious of any conflicting files or directories at the root-level `app/` directory, as these can cause unexpected errors. For instance, an empty `app/layout.tsx` at the root was found to conflict with `src/app/layout.tsx` and caused server errors preventing page loads. Ensure the root `app/` directory is not used for routing if `src/app/` is the intended structure.
